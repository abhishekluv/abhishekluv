# Hi, I’m Abhishek

**Full-Stack .NET Developer & Freelance Consultant** with ~14 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining web applications for small teams and enterprise clients.  

I enjoy taking real business problems, breaking them down, and shipping solutions that are reliable, readable, and easy to change.
